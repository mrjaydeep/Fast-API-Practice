# Fast-API-Practice

#
I have learned the basics of using the FastAPI web framework, and I found it quite similar to Flask in terms of structure and usage. However, one of the key differentiators highlighted in its documentation is its speed. FastAPI is designed to be one of the fastest web frameworks available, largely due to its asynchronous capabilities and its use of Python's modern type hints.
#
FastAPI leverages ASGI (Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface), enabling it to handle a large number of concurrent requests efficiently, making it faster than most traditional web frameworks. It is particularly well-suited for building APIs that need high performance, such as real-time data processing or machine learning applications. Additionally, it includes automatic validation and documentation generation through tools like Swagger UI and ReDoc, enhancing developer productivity.
#
This framework stands out for combining simplicity with performance, offering asynchronous support, and excellent integration with Python 3.7+ features.
